Welcome to Elements of Computer Science! I try to learn the core 
areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that 
knowledge by posting here. 

There is no comment section as the posts are mostly notes to myself 
but you are more than welcome to use my email address for pointing 
out errors.

I also try to learn the core areas of modern mathematics exhaustively; 
then I try to digest that knowledge by posting on [Elements of Mathematics](https://math.ac.nz). Elements of Mathematics is also 
available under the alternative domain [https://maths.ac.nz](https://maths.ac.nz). 

I love telling stories through mathematics and mathematical proofs
provide a wonderful opportunity to tell exciting stories.

I am mostly interested in theoretical computer science, particularly
[The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP)](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) but also
enjoy other areas of computer science closely related to mathematics.
I am also interested in computer typesetting and $\TeX$.
